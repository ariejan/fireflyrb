%h2 Getting started

Getting up and running with Firefly is really easy.

First of all install the <code>firefly</code> gem. Also install <code>shotgun</code> so you can easily start Firefly.

- code :bash do
  gem install firefly shotgun

Next download the sample <code>config.ru</code> and change it to suit your needs.

- code :bash do
  curl https://github.com/ariejan/firefly/raw/master/config.ru.example > config.ru
  vim config.ru

Then, simply start your own Firefly instance.

- code :bash do
  shotgun

%h2 Deployment

Firefly is Rack based application, meaning that you can easily deploy it to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> or a web server using <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>.

Some servers (including Passenger) require you have a <code>public</code> directory available. Simple create an empty <code>public</code> directory and you're good to go.

%h2 Enabling QR Code support

Firefly is able to generate QR Codes containing the short URL on the fly. To enable this you must install two gems: <code>barby</code> and <code>png</code>.

- code :bash do
  gem install barby png

Then restart Firefly and QR Support is ready.

To get the QR code for a specific short URL, simply add <code>.png</code> to the URL.

- code :bash do
  http://aj.gs/3A => http://aj.gs/3A.png

%img(src="http://aj.gs/3A.png" width="100")
